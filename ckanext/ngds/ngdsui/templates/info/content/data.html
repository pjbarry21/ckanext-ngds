<h2>
    Use Data
</h2>

<p>The National Geothermal Data System is a network of information providers and consumers connected by agreeing on conventions for data registration, discovery and interchange. Thus there are a wide variety of options for utilizing information from the system; we anticipate that if the system is successful there will be an ecosystem of <a href="/ngds/resources">user applications</a> that utilize data from the system in a wide variety of ways. See the 'Use apps' page for details on using various off the shelf software with NGDS services.</p>

<img alt="" src="/images/help/utah-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; width: 600px;" />
<p>A typical workflow for a user application in the system would present the user with a choice of activities, such as find data, make a map, plot data in a graph, or the application might be specifically designed to support only one of these activities in which case there is no choice to be made. The first step in an actual user process would be to acquire data appropriate to the chosen activity. Applications might be preconfigured with specific collections, provide a browse tree type search to let users pick collections from a pre-populated list, or the user might fill in a form that runs a search against the NGDS catalog. Metadata for the various resources must be easily accessible in a user-friendly form to enable the user to choose between similar collections. After the user selects resources that will be used, that application will utilize information in the metadata and NGDS data access protocols to obtain the desired collections and the user will work on their project.</p>



<p>The NGDS Design and Build project (based at Boise State University) has developed this <a href="/ngds/map">Map</a> and <a href="/dataset">Library</a> search interface; however, if you’re so inclined, you too can <a href="/ngds/develop">develop</a> an application to search the NGDS such as <a href="http://search.geothermaldatasystem.org/">this search portal</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://lab.usgin.org/applications/doc/csw-client-application" target="_blank">catalog search client extension for ArcMap</a> provides an example of a plug in approach to adding NGDS search and data access to an existing widely used desktop GIS Application (ESRI ArcMap). The add-in provides a button that can be added to standard ArcMap tool bars. The button opens a search window enabling simple bounding box location and free text search of the NGDS catalog. The client uses the OGC CSW interface to send search requests, and parses returned metadata to identify resources that are distributed using the OGC Web Map Service. The user can select one of these resources and add it to their ArcMap project as a new layer. The code base for this application is on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/usgin/arcmap-cswclient" target="_blank">usgin/arcmap-cswclient</a>.</p>

<p>NGDS map services can be used with a variety of existing web map applications that allow connection to OGC Web Map services. Some examples include the <a href="http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/" target="_blank">USGS National Map Viewer</a>, <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/" target="_blank">ArcGIS Online</a>, or NREL’s <a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/gt_prospector" target="_blank">Geothermal Prospector</a>. Web applications, such as these, can be built on a variety of platforms, including the OpenLayers framework, to access and display NGDS data.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://data.geothermaldatasystem.org/" target="_blank">Data-</a>Explorer is another example web application that will access data delivered through OGC Web Feature services and download subsets of the data as a table that can be cut and pasted into common spreadsheet software. The code base for this application is on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/usgin/wfs-search" target="_blank">usgin/wfs-search</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, a number of applications can use NGDS data, some of these are listed at the <a href="/ngds/resources">Resources</a> tab.</p>

    <h2>Publish Data</h2>

    <p><strong>Publishing data to the National Geothermal Data System</strong></p>

    <p>This section is specific for NGDS project participants or entities that would like to become nodes in the network. In this discussion, the term resource will be used in a broad sense to include all the data items of interest that might be registered for use in the NGDS. <em>A </em><a href="http://usgin.org/content/glossary#resource" target="_blank">resource</a> becomes part of the NGDS system when it is locatable using an NGDS catalog search, and accessible according to procedures described in the metadata record obtained from the NGDS catalog. That’s all there is to it. The first step to make any resource part of the system is thus to create a metadata record describing the resource and how it can be obtained. For guidance on metadata preparation, see <a href="http://usgin.org/glossary/metadata">Metadata</a>.</p>

    <p>Although core or other kinds of physical samples, and hard copies of documents can be registered as NGDS resources, this discussion is focused on information resources that can be accessed electronically. Access to a resource via the web may be file-based, via web application, or service-based. Resources may provide different levels of interoperability (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_interoperability" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-Conceptual_interoperability</a>) based on whether their information content is unstructured, structured, or structured according to an <a href="http://schemas.usgin.org/home/">NGDS content model</a> and interchange format.</p>

                <p>A representation of the resource may be retrieved on the WWW as a single digital package (a file!). The internal content of the package may be standardized to varying degrees corresponding to various levels of interoperability</p>

                <p>At the simplest level, a file-based representation of the resource in whatever format it currently exists is made available at some permanent web location (identified by a URL). The contained information can be accessed by users who have software that can recognize and open files in the format it is delivered. They can utilize the information if they can understand the encoding, language, and data structure, but the system provides no support for this understanding, and little or no automation is possible.</p>

                <p>Additional interoperability can be achieved if the information is loaded in a structured format such that the information can be processed using computer software, and made available as a file. Typical example file formats are various spreadsheet file types (e.g. Excel), dBase files, and Microsoft Access databases. To be useful, the metadata must fully describe the data structure, e.g. the tables and fields in each table are defined. With this information, the content of the file can be accessed with computer software.</p>

                <p>A higher degree of interoperability is enable if the information in the file is presented using a documented, community data structure. In this case the metadata can point to the data model specification that is used, and software that is aware of that data structure can process the information content of the file with little or no user interaction. In the NGDS, this would correspond to loading data into a file-based table structure defined by one of the interchange content models.</p>

                <p>Information resources can be made available to users via web-browser based applications that allow them to browse, view, process, analyze, or download in various ways. Such approaches can provide useful functionality, but do not lend to interoperability or resource reuse, because the application functionality is typically tightly coupled to a particular data source. In such a case, application function cannot easily be applied to other data sources, and the data cannot be accessed directly by other applications. Download functions commonly include some filtering and selection of data subset capabilities, but these operations required direct human interaction. The acquired files may be structured or unstructured (see above).</p>

                <p>The intention of the NGDS that structured data be provided through web services, and that NGDS applications use NGDS service interfaces to acquire data that they operate on. In this fashion the work of the data compiler, data hosting, and application development agents in the system can be decoupled.</p>

                <p>Example web applications:</p>

                <p><a href="http://gisweb.unr.edu/geothermal/" target="_blank">Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology Geothermal Web Application</a></p>

                <p><a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/gt_prospector" target="_blank">Geothermal Prospector</a></p>

                </td>
                <td style="width:30%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; ">
                <p>In pursuit of an open data/linked data approach to making data available to the end users, the objective of the NGDS is to make all structured data available through web services using well documented community specifications for service protocols and data interchange formats. This sort of data delivery requires more sophisticated client and server software stacks, and more rigid quality control of the content. Because of the additional up front cost, widely available and useful data will need to be prioritized for web service delivery. Web services may be deployed using custom data schema corresponding to existing database holdings, but the goal is to facilitate use by data consumers by delivering data of a particular type in a consistent schema.</p>

                <p>The NGDS is currently using simple feature data interchange/exchange schema for service-based delivery--these are 'flat' file formats that can be represented as simple spreadsheets or text tables with no information loss. These are developed as content models independent of a particular implementation, currently using Excel workbooks to document the content fields in the model (see <a href="/content-models/data-interchange-content-models">Content Models</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>Data access tiers</strong></p>

    <p>In discussions of NGDS resource publication, it is useful to think in terms of 3 tiers:</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 1.</strong> Information in text, images, or recorded sound. This is unstructured data, and can be very useful to people, but is not amenable to automated computer processing and analysis of the contained information (other than what is possible using text analytics software).</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 2.</strong> Structured data not in an NGDS content model. The structured data must be encoded in a file format that can be determined by inspection or based on file name or metadata. WFS and WMS services may be deployed using such data, but users will have to determine how to extract useful information on a case by case basis. Once the data structure has been determined, some computer processing is possible.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 3.</strong> Structured data in an NGDS content model. May be in a file-based table with field names matching those in the content model, or in an XML document that validates against the XML schema for that model (and version of the model). Tier 3 interoperability is done by using one of the community agreed upon interchange formats available <a href="http://schemas.usgin.org/">here</a>.</p>


    <p><strong>Publishing Data through the US DOE Geothermal Data Repository</strong></p>

    <p>The US DOE GDR is hosted on the Open Energy Information (OpenEI) Platform and designed to receive all US DOE Geothermal Technologies Office grant recipient data. All grant recipients are required to submit their data as it is generated or no later than 90 days after the quarter in which the data is generated. For more information on submitting data to the DOE GDR, please download the <a href="http://geothermaldata.org/sites/geothermaldata.org/files/document/ngds-factsheet-REV1-12-10-12.pdf">DOE GDR brochure</a>, visit the <a href="/help">NGDS information</a> page, or visit the <a href="https://gdr.openei.org/" target="_blank">DOE GDR</a> directly.</p>

<h2>Background on Data</h2>

<p><strong>Data Interchange Content Models</strong></p>

<p>Each feature or observation type delivered using a community data interchange format has an associated content model that defines the information contained in interchange documents for that feature or observation. The content model in its simplest form is a statement that some particular entity (feature or observation) will have some list of properties. For example a content model for a record describing a book might include: title, author, publisher, publication date, publication place, number of pages, and an ISBN number (a URI).</p>


<p>To document these content models, the NGDS is currently using spreadsheet workbooks. Each workbook includes a description of the entity type, a list of the elements (fields, attributes) in a data instance for that entity presented both as a table and a list, and lists of vocabulary terms meant as a start or example for the kinds of vocabularies that will be required in the long run for semantic interoperability. Use of the terms in these example vocabularies will facilitate migration to formal vocabularies later.</p>


<p>A list of currently available models is available at: <a href="http://schemas.usgin.org">http://schemas.usgin.org</a>.</p>


<p>In order to actually use the content models, they must be implemented using an encoding scheme that is computer processable. NGDS is using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to implement the content models, but other schemes may be adopted as the system matures and technology evolves. The important thing is that the information is encoded consistently in a structured, well documented format. This enables computer programs to parse the interchange documents and extract desired information, and as newer encodings are adopted, conversion between formats can be automated using software.</p>

<p>If data to be served are not accounted for by an existing content model, network participants are invited to propose new models. A document with guidelines for construction of a template workbook in available <a href="http://repository.usgin.org/uri_gin/usgin/dlio/340" target="_blank">here</a>. Proposed new content models are submitted for review and adoption for use in the NGDS and broader <a href="http://usgin.org/" target="_blank">USGIN</a> community.</p>


<p><strong>Data Item Categories</strong></p>

<p>The term ‘Data item’ used here to denote a kind of information object; in other contexts these might be called entities, objects, classes, or buckets. Each item corresponds to a feature or observation type that specifies a collection of properties. The purpose of this classification is to analyze the information of interest into types that will use the same data schema, delivery mechanisms, and metadata schema. Initial data types were identified and draft content models developed by surveying project partners at the beginning of the project. The approach was bottom up, based on the kinds of information the state geological surveys reported in their holdings. A summary of this initial survey is available <a href="http://repository.usgin.org/uri_gin/usgin/dlio/171" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<p>The Data Items are grouped into higher-level information categories. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><u>Observation</u> – an information resource representing the event of observing or measuring and recording properties of some feature (Open Geospatial Consortium, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om" target="_blank">Observations and Measurements (O&amp;M)</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_Measurements" target="_blank">Observations</a> represent the basic data that are the foundation for the other information categories. The content model includes: a result, which is the measured or observed value; a feature of interest, which is the feature the observer wishes to characterize; a procedure, which includes information on who made the observation and how it was made. A sampling feature may be specified to record what part of the feature of interest was the actual target of the observation. The observation model allows modeling composite observations, which may represent the aggregation and interpretation of one or more input observations. At least initially we will be using a flattened, simplified version of the full O&amp;M schema that can be served using OGC simple features.</li>
	<li><u>Feature</u> – an information resource representing some identifiable thing of interest in the world. A feature is described by a collection of attributes that are typically each the result of one or more observations. Features present a more aggregated or interpretive view of the world than observations (although a feature can be modeled as the result of an observation). Features will be delivered via OGC Web Feature Services (Open Geospatial Consortium, Web Feature Service, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs" target="_blank">http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs</a>) or other similar services. Typically, features have a geographic location.</li>
	<li><u>Document</u> – A packaged body of intellectual work; has an author, title, some status with respect to review/authority/quality. ‘USGS peer reviewed’ would be a 'status property'. Documents may have varying levels of authority, e.g., ‘gray’ literature, unpublished documents, peer-review in scientific publication, community vetted, etc. A document may have a variety of physical manifestations (pdf file, hard-bound book, tiff scan, word processor document...), and versions may exist as the document is traced through some publication process. They may be map, vector graphics, or text. Media containing recorded sound and moving images are included as document types.</li>
	<li><u>Coverage</u> – A dataset that reports the values of some continuously varying property over some spatial or temporal extent. Examples include well logs that report the values of resistivity, density, or some other property along the well bore, gravity maps that report measured (perhaps by extrapolation) values of gravity over some geographic region. A coverage may be the result of one or more observations. A coverage may also be associated with an individual feature, such as a coverage showing the thickness distribution of a geologic unit or the average temperature at some depth in a Geothermal system</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Key Data Terms</strong></p>

<p><em>Metadata</em> should be created and submitted to an NGDS catalog for any resource that is meant to be accessible individually.</p>


<p>The required metadata content is explained in <a href="http://lab.usgin.org/profiles/doc/metadata-content-recommendations" target="_blank">USGIN metadata recommendations</a>. These requirements proscribe the content of the metadata, but not the delivery format. ISO19139 xml is the preferred encoding based on its expanding adoption in the community. <a href="http://repository.usgin.org/uri_gin/usgin/dlio/499" target="_blank">USGIN guidelines for implementing the content recommendations in ISO19139 XML</a> are available, as well as a detailed <a href="http://repository.usgin.org/uri_gin/usgin/dlio/337" target="_blank">USGIN profile</a> for interoperable metadata using ISO19139.</p>


<p>FGDC xml is widely used and if participants already have workflow in place using this format and can provide the requested metadata content, this can be harvested using an FGDC to ISO transformation. FGDC XML should be tested to validate against the official XML schema at <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/schemas/metadata/fgdc-std-001-1998.xsd" target="_blank">http://www.fgdc.gov/schemas/metadata/fgdc-std-001-1998.xsd</a>. Please confer with the <a href="/ngds/contact">NGDS developer team</a> about metadata formatting to facilitate import of metadata into the NGDS catalog</p>


<p><em>Individual documents</em> require one metadata record per document. Some document types may consist of a bundle of files, e.g. ESRI shape file. In general these should be bundled into a single file like a zip archive or UNIX tar file. The metadata must include the URL at which the document can be accessed. These documents might be scans of well logs, scanned reports or publications, or data in a spreadsheet, such as an Excel file.</p>


<p><em>Datasets</em> (data products) are typically considered as individual works (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records" target="_blank">FRBR</a>), unified by the compilation activity that brings information together into a single data structure, editing and verifying content as necessary. This approach is based on our interest in facilitating data access by users, and the observation that such a user is first interested in a particular kind of data; upon finding a fit-for-purpose collection, they will next want to know how to get the data. From this perspective a collection work (data product, resource) will have a single metadata record that may include specification of multiple distributions of the resource. For instance a borehole temperature dataset may be available with all the records in an Excel spreadsheet, or visualized through a web map service, or individual observations may be accessed through a web feature service (see for example <a href="http://repository.stategeothermaldata.org/repository/resource/168566464e3d5f8f3cde3b9fc0049f45/" target="_blank">Montana Hot Springs</a>).</p>


<p>At a more granular level, individual records (features, objects) in a dataset may include source information, documenting details of observation or measurement procedure and other information specific to a particular data type. This might include information such as location, data and time of observations, and the source of the data. These feature-level metadata are delivered with the data, and only summarized in the work-level collection metadata that are published to the NGDS-compliant catalog. This granularity issue can be difficult because of differing perspectives on what is data or metadata, differing granularity of documentation available, and different use-case priorities.</p>
